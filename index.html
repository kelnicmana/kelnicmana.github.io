        <p>Thanks for visiting. I am currently learning about web dev (HTML, CSS, and Javascript) as well
            the GitHub website and using Git through the terminal. I'll be using this website to test
            things out as I learn about them so I can see them live and test out how they look on 
            multiple devices and browsers. This site is currently coded with a small about of very basic 
            HTML and CSS.
        </p>
